## 🩺 Problem Summary
A pediatric clinic has a doctor with **dynamic working hours** (e.g., 3–9 pm, 4–10 pm, and varying days per week).  
Two assistants handle patient reservations **manually on paper**, splitting hours into sections and offering slots to parents.  

### Issues
- Patients often cluster around **6–8 pm**, causing overcrowding and long waits.  
- Other slots remain **underutilized**, wasting the doctor’s time.  
- Manual booking is error-prone and inefficient.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build a **digital reservation system** (desktop or web-based) that:  
- Digitizes patient booking.  
- Distributes reservations evenly across available hours.  
- Provides assistants with tools to manage schedules and reduce congestion.  
- Modern UI with media query 

---

## ✅ Core Features (MVP – First Release)
1. **Local storage app** (data cleared daily for simplicity).  
2. **Login system** for admins/assistants.  
3. **Patient info form** (child name, parent name, phone, address, etc.) --> will use google locator for spatial analysis 
4. **Doctor schedule management**:  
   - Enter working days and hours.  
   - Fetch public holidays via API.  
   - Modify schedules weekly, monthly, or quarterly.  
5. **Reservation management**:  
   - CRUD operations (add, edit, delete).  
   - Drag-and-drop patients into available slots.  
   - Option for “quick reservation” (fixed 15 minutes).  
6. **Immediate confirmation** for parents once booked.  
7. **Basic dashboard** with statistics (reservations per day, slot utilization).

## 🚀 Recommended Enhancements
1. **Smart Slot Allocation**  
   - Auto-suggest slots to balance load and avoid clustering.  
   - Consider patient preferences (morning/evening).  

2. **Notifications & Reminders**  
   - SMS/WhatsApp reminders for parents.  
   - Alerts for assistants when slots are nearly full.  

3. **Waitlist & Cancellation Handling**  
   - Cancelled slots auto-offered to waitlisted patients.  

4. **Role-Based Access**  
   - Admin/Doctor: manage schedules, view analytics.  
   - Assistant: manage reservations only.  
   - Viewer: read-only access.  

5. **Data Export & Backup**  
   - Export reservations to Excel/Google Sheets.  
   - Keep records even if local storage resets.  

6. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**  
   - Peak hours.  
   - Average wait time.  
   - Slot utilization rate.  
   - Helps doctor optimize working hours.

## 🛠️ Suggested Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (web) or Electron (desktop).  
- **Storage (MVP)**: LocalStorage / IndexedDB.  
- **Later upgrade**: Firebase, Supabase, or MySQL for cloud sync.  
- **Drag & Drop**: React DnD library.  
- **Charts**: Chart.js or D3.js.  
- **Holiday API**: Calendarific or Google Calendar API.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Build a **simple web app** (React + LocalStorage).  
2. Create **reservation form + slot allocation logic**.  
3. Add **drag-and-drop scheduling** for assistants.  
4. Implement **basic dashboard** (slot utilization, patient count).  
5. Gradually add **notifications, waitlist, and cloud sync**.
