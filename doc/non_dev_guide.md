# Non-Developer Guide: Clinic Reservation App

## How to Use the App
1. **Open the App**: Double-click the application shortcut (or navigate to the URL provided by your developer).
2. **Login**: Ask your developer for the password.
3. **Daily Routine**:
   - The app automatically clears yesterday's data when you open it today.
   - Start adding patients as they call or arrive.
   - Drag them to their assigned hour.

## Customization (Do It Yourself)

### Changing the Clinic Name
You don't need a developer to change the name shown at the top of the screen!
1. Log in.
2. Click **Settings** in the top right corner.
3. Under **General**, type the new name in the "Clinic Name" box.
4. Click **Save**.

### Adding Custom Questions
If the doctor wants to ask new questions (like "Temperature" or "Follow-up"):
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Look for **Form Editor**.
3. Type the question name (e.g., "Temperature") and click **Add Field**.
4. Now, every new registration form will have this question.

### Resetting Passwords
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Enter a new password in the **Update Password** box.
3. Click **Update**.
4. Note: You will need this new password next time you login.

## Troubleshooting
- **"I can't see the schedule!"**: Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl+R).
- **"Data disappeared!"**: Did you open the app on a new day? The app resets daily automatically.
- **"I need to clear everything manually"**: Go to **Settings** -> **Danger Zone**, type "delete", and click the red button.
